## Insights (Previous Groups)

Do not turn to any of those "easy web app maker" sites and source their code. We tried this for the first sprint and a half, and ultimately we discovered that the coding conventions are so diverse that none of the tutorial code or prior knowledge you have gained applies. It takes longer to understand and modify this code to your needs than it does to make your own web app with your obtained knowledge.

Make sure everyone is on the same page throughout the course of the semester. Take your stand-up meeting times to make sure everyone understands the concepts and has everything they need to work on their assigned tasks. It is okay to slow down to have somebody catch up because by the end of the project it will be a lot more efficient and helpful to have them on the same page.

Use Trello to you advantage, the scrum stuff might feel tedious but it helps the whole team stay organized and keeps all the User stories and tasks for that sprint in line. Consistently update it with the task you're working on to keep the whole team on the same page. Refer back to it when looking for tasks to keep the team going in the same direction.

Create a schedule and stick to it (google calendar is a great tool for this). When writing the code for the website, unknown issues frequently come up. In order to ensure that you have enough time to finish a sprint, leave yourself time at the end of each sprint to tie up loose ends.

Use pair programming to your advantage. Just because it may seem faster to divide and conquer in terms of being able to get tasks done doesn't mean it necessarily is. Having a second set of eyes to catch errors and talk things through with can be extremely beneficial and save you tons of time in the long run.

## Initial Setup

1. Clone this repository
2. From a terminal in VS code, run the following:

```
npm install
```

3. Create a .env file in the root directory

```
MONGO_URI= <find in trello>
SESSION_SECRET= <secret key>
```

4. Run the server from the VS Code debugger
5. Go to a web browser and type in localhost:8080
6. Once signed in with google, go to localhost:8080/addUser and add yourself as a user.

## Data Schema

![alt text](dataStructure.png)

The image above shows the dependencies of the different classes in the dat structure. All of the models are written in js except temps.json (you can find the data model under assets/server/model). Download MongoDB Compass to easily access the database with the same URI written in your ejs file. You can look through Compass to see what the dependencies look like in the actual app.

To explain the image more, each arrow shows a different dependency. The beginning of the arrow starts at the property that needs information from a different class, which is where the head of the arrow points to. The dotted line and arrow that goes from menuItem to drink is because every time the user clicks on a drink from the menu page, a new instance of drink is created. Drink is supposed to be a customized version of menuItem. The dotted arrow shows that drink is not directly dependent on menuItem in the database, but pulls from its properties when a new drink is created. That's because menuItems don't reference all of the toppings or flavors so no one can order a blue raspberry coffee, so only certain flavors, toppings, and temperatures are available for each menuItem and drink.

Enabled is on it's own because it's a separate class. That is the boolean value that the app references to see if ordering is turned on or off. During passing periods or outside of the Half Caf's hours, the baristas and admin can turn ordering off to prevent people from ordering and waiting for a drink that's not being made. Enabled uses a Websocket to check and see if it's been updated every second, and if it has, it reloads every page to either disable ordering or to sync the slider on the admin and barista side.
