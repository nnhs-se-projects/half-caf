## Insights (Previous Groups)

Do not turn to any of those "easy web app maker" sites and source their code. We tried this for the first sprint and a half, and ultimately we discovered that the coding conventions are so diverse that none of the tutorial code or prior knowledge you have gained applies. It takes longer to understand and modify this code to your needs than it does to make your own web app with your obtained knowledge.

Make sure everyone is on the same page throughout the course of the semester. Take your stand-up meeting times to make sure everyone understands the concepts and has everything they need to work on their assigned tasks. It is okay to slow down to have somebody catch up because by the end of the project it will be a lot more efficient and helpful to have them on the same page.

Use Trello to you advantage, the scrum stuff might feel tedious but it helps the whole team stay organized and keeps all the User stories and tasks for that sprint in line. Consistently update it with the task you're working on to keep the whole team on the same page. Refer back to it when looking for tasks to keep the team going in the same direction.

Create a schedule and stick to it (google calendar is a great tool for this). When writing the code for the website, unknown issues frequently come up. In order to ensure that you have enough time to finish a sprint, leave yourself time at the end of each sprint to tie up loose ends.

Use pair programming to your advantage. Just because it may seem faster to divide and conquer in terms of being able to get tasks done doesn't mean it necessarily is. Having a second set of eyes to catch errors and talk things through with can be extremely beneficial and save you tons of time in the long run.
